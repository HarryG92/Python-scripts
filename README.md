# Python-scripts
 Various bits of code I wrote while learning Python, in varying stages of completeness.

This was all originally created as learning projects for me or to help teach things to my tutoring students, so it's poorly documented.

The older bits especially are not very well coded.

I intend to produce better example pieces of code for a portfolio; this repository is largely just archival.
