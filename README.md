# Python-scripts
 Various bits of code I wrote while learning Python, in varying stages of completeness.

This was all originally created as learning projects for me or to help teach things to my tutoring students, so it's poorly documented and disorganised.

The older bits especially are not very well coded.

This repository is essentially archival.
